    "In this report, we embark on a captivating journey into the world of dog ratings and breeds on Twitter. Our objective is to analyze a rich dataset of tweets by WeRateDogs and uncover valuable insights. However, before we can plunge into the realm of analysis, it is essential to ensure the dataset is thoroughly cleaned and prepared. In this data cleaning report, we detail the meticulous steps taken to address various issues and refine the dataset for robust analysis.\n",
